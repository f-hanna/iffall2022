                Spring was never waiting for us, dear
                <br>
                It ran one step ahead
                <br>
                As we followed in the dance
                <br>

                MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
                <br>
                All the sweet, green icing flowing down
                <br>
                Someone left the cake out in the rain
                <br>
                I don't think that I can take it
                <br>
                'Cause it took so long to bake it
                <br>
                And I'll never have that recipe again

                I recall the yellow cotton dress
                <br>
                Foaming like a wave
                <br>
                On the ground beneath your knees
                <br>
                The birds, like tender babies in your hands
                <br>
                And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees
                <br>
