        <h1>Fried Milk</h1>
        <p>Fried milk is new star dessert in all Chinese bakery store. Although considered as not healthy enough, it is
            loved by the younger generation because it is so satisfying. This dessert is originated from Cantonese
            cuisine. But the traditional Chinese version fried milk is not coated with bread crumbs. Adding bread crumbs
            is a modernized way but more popular in younger generation.</p>

        <h2>Recipe Site References</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a>
                <p>Epicurious is one of the sites that interested me in terms of recipe layout. I love the visual feel of the website: it's very bright, colorful and casual. Furthermore, when looking to the recipes, the hierachy of information is very clear. I really like how the portion size of the recipe is highlighted at the top. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/">Pinch of Yum</a>
                <p>Pinch of Yum is an interesting site. It's one of the recipe sites where it tells the writer's life story before actually telling the recipe, which is something i would want to avoid. However, one aspect I really like about the site is that in its excessive rambling, it tells users what common/cheaper substitutions that could be used. I really like that way to include more dish variation, as opposed to a simple step-by-step process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a>
                <p>I picked out Yummly simply because it was probably my favorite aesethetically for recipe sites. I really like the modern interface the site has going on. The personalized recipe was a neat touch and the recipe layout itself is very simple and effective.</p>

        <h2>Cool Sites :D</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.palette.eco/paints">Palette</a>
                <p>In general, I really like how the UI of the site has really big and pretty images to promote their business. The business sells eco friendly paints and the whole aesethetic of the site reflects that. The color palette and type communicates an earthy and healthy feel, alongside the fact that the nav bar is clear at the top.</p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://glamapple.kotobuki-yu.com/">Glam Apple</a>
                <p>Because I'm doing an Asian dessert, I wanted to create of a more Eastern aesethetic. I chose the Glam Apple site because it's aesethetic I think fits: colorful, busy, and fun. Furthermore, I love the implementation of big text. However, the biggest issue is its lagging load speed...</p>

                <a href="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/">ETQ</a>
                <p>On the other hand, the minimalist white style of ETQ is also pretty appealing. For a user that just wants the recipe, having a simple and clean interface is the best.</p>
