        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open
            composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the
            effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, unusual visual angles, and inclusion of movement
            as a crucial element of human perception and experience. Impressionism originated with a group of
            Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

            The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the
            style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which
            provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper
            Le Charivari. The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in
            other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.
