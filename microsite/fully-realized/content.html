                Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such 17th-century Dutch painters as Jan Steen, had
                emphasized common subjects, but their methods of composition were traditional. They arranged their
                compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. J. M. W. Turner, while an artist
                of the Romantic era, anticipated the style of impressionism with his artwork. The Impressionists relaxed
                the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often
                resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance. Photography was gaining
                popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired
                Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the
                day-to-day lives of people.

            The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by
            photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape
            paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more
            efficiently and reliably".

            In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather
            than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do
            better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the
            image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".[32] The Impressionists sought to express their
            perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively
            what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".[33] Photography encouraged painters to
            exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the
            first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".

                Another major influence was Japanese ukiyo-e art prints (Japonism). The art of these prints contributed
                significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of
                Impressionism. An example is Monet's Jardin à Sainte-Adresse, 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and
                composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints.

            Edgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.[36] His The Dance Class (La classe de danse) of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the Little Dancer of Fourteen Years.
