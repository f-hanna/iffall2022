                <li>Hanna Fu</li>
                <li>Communication Design, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction</li>

        <li>I am always interested in the intersection between design and technology, so this course was always something I wanted to take.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Aside from this class, I am taking 204 and 330.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I just hope to learn more about the front end language in general and become extremely proficient in it!</li>
        <br>
        <li>I've experienced this before when designing my own website, but this biggest difference from traditional design is keeping in mind the different breakpoints for the different size screens. I have to deal with different padding, type, and even image placement depending on the screen, which makes site designing a little more tedious. </li>
        <br>
        <li>I really like the 
            <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas">Canvas LMS homepage </a>
            UI! A lot of modern websites are often monochromatic, with a splash of a singular color, but the canvas homepage utilizes two bright colors effectively. Furthermore, it uses serif type as the header, which is increasingly rare these days. All this combined makes a unique and visually pleasing experience. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            A site that I believe exemplifies effective communication is 
            <a href="https://www.palette.eco/paints">Palette</a>. The business sells eco friendly paints and the whole aesethetic of the site reflects that. The color palette and type communicates an earthy and healthy feel, alongside the fact that the nav bar is clear at the top. I also really like the option of being able to sample the different paints underneath the hero section. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/">Figma </a>
            is a website that works really well. It has clear and easy website navigation alongside sleek and creative graphics. It's the epitomization of modern website design.
